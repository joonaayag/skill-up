## About the Project

**SkillUp** is a web platform designed to connect students, teachers, and local companies through academic projects and job opportunities. It enables users to browse and manage student projects, publish and apply for job offers, and foster collaboration between the educational community and the local job market.

This platform was developed in just 30 days as part of the final academic project by Jonay Aguilar Menéndez. While fully functional, the code still has a lot of room for improvement in terms of structure, optimization, and maintainability. The main goal was to create a useful foundation that could grow over time to better support communication and opportunity-sharing between students and professionals.

### Technologies Used

- **PHP** with the **Laravel** framework for backend development.  
- **Blade** templating engine for dynamic and reusable views.  
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive and modern UI design.  
- **Alpine.js** for lightweight JavaScript interactivity.  
- Custom **JavaScript scripts** for enhanced user experience and frontend behavior.

### Infrastructure & Services

- **Railway** for cloud deployment and database hosting.  
- **Amazon AWS S3** for secure file storage and asset delivery.
