## About the Project

**SkillUp** is a web platform designed to connect students, teachers, and local companies through academic projects and job opportunities. The platform allows users to browse and manage student projects, publish and apply to job offers, and promote collaboration between the educational community and the local job market.

This project was developed as part of a final academic project by **Jonay Aguilar Menéndez**, with the goal of creating a useful tool to improve communication and opportunity-sharing between students and professionals. It aims to support both career development and educational innovation.

### Technologies Used

- **Blade** templating engine for dynamic and reusable views.
